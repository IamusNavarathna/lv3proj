        Lost Vikings 3 Project Engine


GET THE CODE
============
1.) Be sure you have Git installed.
2.) Navigate to a folder with write access
3.) git clone git://github.com/fgenesis/lv3proj.git

Alternatively, download a tarball with the source:
http://github.com/fgenesis/lv3proj/tarball/master



BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

Note: Under Windows, only building in 32 bit is supported for now.

Windows, Visual Studio:
1.) Open the LV3.sln file
2.) Set the build configuration to Release, unless you don't mind speed.
3.) Build the solution (Default hotkey: F7)
4.) The exe files are now in <LV3-root>/bin.
5.) In case you need additional DLLs, look in src/lib/win32.
    You don't need: - jpeg.dll, smpeg.dll, libtiff-3.dll -


Windows + MinGW, CodeBlocks, Linux, and maybe Mac OSX:
1.) Be sure you have CMake, SDL, SDL_mixer and SDL_image installed.
2.) Go to the project root dir. (contains LV3.sln and CMakeLists.txt)
3.) Create a new folder where the compilation process should take place.
4.) Navigate into that folder.
5.) Configure the build type and generate makefiles or project files as necessary.
    On Windows, you can use cmake-gui, on linux ccmake or anything else.
6.) Start compiling. Cross your fingers and hope that it works.
7.) make install. The finished bins are installed to <LV3-root>/bin.
    Does not require root. Does not install into system directories.
    Note: Do *NOT* use DESTDIR with make install, it will horribly fail.
    If you want to have the binaries installed somewhere, make a normal
    make install and copy the bin folder afterwards.

In short, the required commands (on linux) are as follows:
(Be in LV3 root dir)
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
(alternatively, 'ccmake ..' if you need to specify advanced things)
make
make install
-- The bins are now in ../bin and ready. (in case compiling them actually worked)

To build the basepak.lvpa file (not required, but can't be bad to have it)
(be in <LV3-root>/bin)
./lvpak -c9 -f basepak.listfile a basepak.lvpa



MISSING FILES
=============

Some files are not included in the Git repo because of their size,
for these, visit https://github.com/fgenesis/lv3proj/downloads
and look for files named missing_*.zip.
The file name or folder structure should make clear where the files inside should be put,
if not, there's maybe a description file inside.
